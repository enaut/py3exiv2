py3exiv2
*******

Welcome to py3exiv2, a python 3 binding to exiv2 (http://exiv2.org/), the C++
library for manipulation of EXIF, IPTC and XMP image metadata.
It is a python 3 module that allows your python scripts to read and write
metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, thumbnails) embedded in image files
(JPEG, TIFF, ...).

Point your browser to http://exiv2.org/metadata.html for the complete metadata
tag reference.


Build dependencies
==================

py3exiv2 depends on the following libraries:

 * python (≥ 3.3)
 * boost.python3 (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html)
 * exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org/)

Some examples in src/ use PyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org/) and PyQt
(http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/) to display image previews,
those are optional dependencies.

This is a typical list of build dependencies for a Debian/Ubuntu system:

 * python-all-dev (≥ 3.2)
 * libexiv2-dev (≥ 0.20)
 * libboost-python-dev (≥ 1.35)
 * g++


Building and installing
=======================

To build and install the library, while in the top-level directory
(e.g. '~/dev/p3yexiv2', which should contain a file named 'configure.py'),
run the following commands:

 $ python3 configure.py     # To chek your environment and write the Makefile
 $ make                     # To compile the lib
 $ make -i                  # as administrator to install all files

The result of the build is a dynamic library, libexiv2python.so, in the build/
directory. This is the low-level binding. It is in turn used in a higher level
module, pyexiv2.
The `make -i` command installs the two modules in your site-specific directory
for Python modules (e.g. '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/' on Linux).

To use pyexiv2 in your scripts, simply import the pyexiv2 module.


Documentation
=============

Please refer to the internal documentation for a guide on how to use pyexiv2.
In a python interpreter, type:

 >>> import pyexiv2
 >>> help(pyexiv2)
