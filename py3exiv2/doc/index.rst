Welcome to py3exiv2's documentation!
====================================

py3exiv2 is a `Python 3 <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_ binding to 
`exiv2 <http://exiv2.org/>`_, the C++ library
for manipulation of :abbr:`EXIF (EXchangeable Image File)`,
:abbr:`IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council)` and
:abbr:`XMP (eXtensible Metadata Platform)` image metadata.
It is a python 3 module that allows your scripts to read and write
metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, thumbnails) embedded in image files
(JPEG, TIFF, ...).

It is designed as a high-level interface to the functionalities offered by
libexiv2. Using python's built-in data types and standard modules, it provides
easy manipulation of image metadata.
